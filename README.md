# TaskState

There are two SwiftUI views, ContentView and ContentViewWithProgress.
Swap between them in TaskStateApp. ContentView requires tapping the
"show sheet" button twice in order to view content in the sheet.
ContentViewWithProgress only requires tapping the "show sheet" button
once to see content in the sheet.

I think this is a SwiftUI bug.
