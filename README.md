# TaskState

There are two SwiftUI views, `ContentView` and `ContentViewWithProgress`.
Swap between them in `TaskStateApp` by commenting and uncommenting lines.
`ContentView` requires tapping the "show sheet" button twice in order to
view content in the sheet. `ContentViewWithProgress` only requires tapping
the "show sheet" button once to see content in the sheet.

I think this is a SwiftUI bug.
